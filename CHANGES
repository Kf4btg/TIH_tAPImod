1.1.3
    -   Refactored most loose option-fields into collections (e.g. Dictionaries or arrays)
    -   Added a generic/inheritable button class and a somewhat less generic toggle-button class inheriting from the former.
        -   Used these to create buttons that will allow the Vanilla actions (depositall, quickstack, lootall) to respect locked item-slots in some fashion.
        -   Needed to add a ModWorld class to make sure the button states were properly initialized when the world was loaded.
    -   Addressed issue where loading a player would sometimes load the saved locked-slot configuration from a different player.

1.1.2b
    -   Added ability to shift-click items in and out of the Item Reforge slot.

1.1.2a
    -   Experimental implementation of a shift-left-click-to-move-item action (disabled by default)
        -   Added because I suspected I may be having some conflicts with Shockah's mods (and I really didn't want to live without that ability...)
        -   There are a few differences in functionality, but one noticeable addition I did make was to allow shift-moving in and out of the guide's craft-info slot.

1.1.2
    -   Added Categories:
        -   Potion (separate from other consumables), Block, Brick, Wood, Tool, Special (boss summon, stat increase items), Misc_Materials (that fail to fit any other category)
    -   tweaked sort order of categories and individual category sorting rules.
    -   Fixed shift-right-click picking up items bug.
    -   A large number of back-end changes, many of which were intended to bring most of my reimplemented operations closer into parity with Vanilla.
    -   Changed QuickStack to only stack a particular type of coin if that type already exists in the container (rather than move all coins)
    -   Fixed bug where Reverse-Stack would pull any ammo in chest, rather than just types that were already in the player's ammo slots.

Version 1.1.1+tr14a
    -   Added new Categories, all pulled out of the "tile" category:
        -   Mechanism, crafting station, light sources, furniture, statues, wall decoration, banners, decorative clutter

Version 1.1.1+tr14a
    -   Added Smart Deposit action
    -   Added Smart Loot action
    -   Added separate categories for Ore, Bars, Gems, and Seeds

Version 1.1.1-rc1+tr14a
    -   Major overhaul of the sorting system. This may not be so noticeable to the player--outside of some improvements to the arrangement of sorted items--but greatly increases the ease with which the sorting parameters can be tweaked and paves the way for more player control of the sorting and categorization system in the future.

Version 1.1.0-rc3+tr14a
    -   Added mod-option to entirely disable the locking mechanism
    -   Add mod-option for selecting whether to sort items to end or beginning of inventory
        -   can set for inventory, chests, or both
    -   Added reverse-sort function
        -   Hold shift + press sort key
        -   Can set reverse sort as default for inventory, chests, or both
    -   Improved sorting parameters

Version 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
    -   Added ability to lock items in place by shift-right-clicking the slot. Items in these slots will not be moved by the sort operation.
