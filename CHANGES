Version 1.1.1-rc1+tr14a
    -   Major overhaul of the sorting system. This may not be so noticeable to the player--outside of some improvements to the arrangement of sorted items--but greatly increases the ease with which the sorting parameters can be tweaked and paves the way for more player control of the sorting and categorization system in the future.

        -   Can set reverse sort as default for inventory, chests, or both
    -   Improved sorting parameters

Version 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
    -   Added ability to lock items in place by shift-right-clicking the slot. Items in these slots will not be moved by the sort operation.
