1.2.0-rc3
    -   Total rework of button system.  Was a huge effort, but the end result isn't largely noticeable on the front end.  However, should improve maintainability and perhaps support customization in the future.
    -   Replaced vanilla text buttons with enhanced versions that support the new functions of the mod.
    -   Added an option to have graphical buttons instead of the original text buttons.
    -   Added option to disable the player-inventory buttons.
    -   Removed the separate chest buttons (at least for now).
    -   Added keybind-tip to button names/tooltips.
    -   Added modoptions to show/hide tooltips, show/hide keybind-hints
    -   Some random extras to the buttons:
        -   The icon-buttons for Sort will now reverse-sort on right-click. Similarly but backwards for reverse-sort.
        -   For no reason whatsoever LootAll in icon mode will clean stacks on right click.
        -   The text version of LootAll now toggles to Sort when pressing shift.  This sort button also reverse-sorts on r-click.
    -   Improved Sound handling.

1.2.0-rc2
    -   Improved multiplayer support:
        -   Changed the way textures are loaded to hopefully reduce conflicts with the dedicated server.
        -   Added code that wraps all the actions pertaining to moving items in-to/out-of/around-in chests.
            -   All the wrapper does is record the contents of the chest before the action, which it then compares to the chest's contents after the action and sends a message to the server to update each slot that has changed.
            -   This seems to work well, though there may be performance issues we should keep an eye out for.
        -   This all still needs major testing.
    -   Changed up position and appearance of buttons.  "Shift"-ed alternate actions and locking-features are still in place.
        -   The buttons for the player inventory are above the coin & ammo slots. These disappear when a chest is open.
        -   The buttons for an open chest appear to the left of the trash slot. Only present when using a chest.
    -   Known Issues:
        -   Both sets of buttons have VERY low opacity unless the player is hovering the mouse over them. This is intended to make them less intrusive and to preserve the Vanilla aesthetics and experience as much as possible. A side effect of this is that the player can easily lose sight of them on bright or complex backgrounds, since they'll blend in and become effectively invisible until the mouse is placed over them--and even with the mouse over them, they still sometimes blend in with complex backgrounds of the same general color. This may be a little disorienting when trying to quickly find the button one wants. I think I may at some point try to implement a mod-option to allow the player to adjust the opacity.
        -   Stupid tooltips still get drawn under other UI-elements. Bleh.


1.2.0-rc1
    -   First complete-ish version of buttons for sort/stack/restock/smart-deposit. Includes ability to lock down slots from being affected by QuickStack/Deposit All.
    -   How to use:
        -   Mouse-over the buttons to get a tooltip of what each button is/does. Some buttons will only show up when a chest is open.
        -   Click button.
        -   Done.
        -   Ok, there's more.  Holding Shift will change the appearance and function of some buttons:
            -   Sort -> Reverse Sort
            -   Restock -> QuickStack.  Left click to use, but right click to toggle whether or not locked slots will be affected by the action.
            -   Smart Deposit -> Deposit All.  Same deal as QuickStack; left-click to use, right-click to lock.
    -   Known Issues:
        -   The Vanilla QS/DA buttons are NOT affected by the locking function; only the extra ways added by this mod (keybind, new button) will respect this setting. It may be impossible (short of duplicating an _enormous_ chunk of Terraria's code--or having a tAPI dev add some hooks in those places), to inject the necessary checks into the vanilla functionality.  I'm looking into whether it'd be possible to just replace/override the buttons altogether, either with my own buttons or, perhaps, some that look exactly the same.
        -   The tooltips are currently drawn _under_ any other UI elements they happen to cross (usually item slots or other buttons).  I...have no idea why. I have some wild guesses as to why, but they're definitely not near developed or substantiated enough to call ideas. This one may take some investigation, and it's been on the bottom of the fix-me list since it doesn't really affect functionality.

1.1.3
    -   Refactored most loose option-fields into collections (e.g. Dictionaries or arrays)
    -   Added a generic/inheritable button class and a somewhat less generic toggle-button class inheriting from the former.
        -   Used these to create buttons that will allow the Vanilla actions (depositall, quickstack, lootall) to respect locked item-slots in some fashion.
        -   Needed to add a ModWorld class to make sure the button states were properly initialized when the world was loaded.
    -   Addressed issue where loading a player would sometimes load the saved locked-slot configuration from a different player.

1.1.2b
    -   Added ability to shift-click items in and out of the Item Reforge slot.

1.1.2a
    -   Experimental implementation of a shift-left-click-to-move-item action (disabled by default)
        -   Added because I suspected I may be having some conflicts with Shockah's mods (and I really didn't want to live without that ability...)
        -   There are a few differences in functionality, but one noticeable addition I did make was to allow shift-moving in and out of the guide's craft-info slot.

1.1.2
    -   Added Categories:
        -   Potion (separate from other consumables), Block, Brick, Wood, Tool, Special (boss summon, stat increase items), Misc_Materials (that fail to fit any other category)
    -   tweaked sort order of categories and individual category sorting rules.
    -   Fixed shift-right-click picking up items bug.
    -   A large number of back-end changes, many of which were intended to bring most of my reimplemented operations closer into parity with Vanilla.
    -   Changed QuickStack to only stack a particular type of coin if that type already exists in the container (rather than move all coins)
    -   Fixed bug where Reverse-Stack would pull any ammo in chest, rather than just types that were already in the player's ammo slots.

Version 1.1.1+tr14a
    -   Added new Categories, all pulled out of the "tile" category:
        -   Mechanism, crafting station, light sources, furniture, statues, wall decoration, banners, decorative clutter

Version 1.1.1+tr14a
    -   Added Smart Deposit action
    -   Added Smart Loot action
    -   Added separate categories for Ore, Bars, Gems, and Seeds

Version 1.1.1-rc1+tr14a
    -   Major overhaul of the sorting system. This may not be so noticeable to the player--outside of some improvements to the arrangement of sorted items--but greatly increases the ease with which the sorting parameters can be tweaked and paves the way for more player control of the sorting and categorization system in the future.

Version 1.1.0-rc3+tr14a
    -   Added mod-option to entirely disable the locking mechanism
    -   Add mod-option for selecting whether to sort items to end or beginning of inventory
        -   can set for inventory, chests, or both
    -   Added reverse-sort function
        -   Hold shift + press sort key
        -   Can set reverse sort as default for inventory, chests, or both
    -   Improved sorting parameters

Version 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
    -   Added ability to lock items in place by shift-right-clicking the slot. Items in these slots will not be moved by the sort operation.
