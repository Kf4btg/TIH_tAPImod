The Invisible Hand
==================
### A mod for Terraria made using tAPI.

[Forum thread link coming soon]

This mod implements a number of convenience features to make managing one's inventory in Terraria as close to painless as possible, saving time and allowing the player to get back to enjoying the game as quickly as possible.


#### Current features
  *  Keybinds added for several existing mechanics
    1.   Quickstack : default key "Q"
    2.  Loot All : default key "Z"
    3.  Deposit All : default key "Y"
  *  New actions added, along with corresponding keybinds. These will act on the player's inventory or an open chest.
    1.  Consolidate Stacks
        *  Default key "X"
        *  Collects stackable item-types and puts them into as few maximized-stacks as possible.
    2.  Sort Inventory
        -   Default key "R"
        -   First, performs a stack-consolidation, then groups all items together with other items in their category (e.g. pickaxes, blocks, accessories, etc.) and re-sorts the player's inventory or currently open chest.

#### Experimental/Beta Features
  *  Lock item-slots in the player's main inventory by holding shift and then right-clicking (do the same again to unlock). An item in a locked slot will not be moved around when the player sorts their inventory.

#### More features coming!
